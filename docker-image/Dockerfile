#
# This Dockerfile is used to create a bootstrap Jenkins image.
#
# It contains no specific Kadaster infrastructure dependencies. Infrastructure dependencies are 
# added using an additional Dockerfile on top of this one that is maintained within the Kadaster
# premisis. This way, we keep the Kadaster infrastructure details secret.
#
# This image is built with the automated build facilities of http://dockerhub.comn.
#

# Use the (latest if possible) LTS version of Jenkins
FROM jenkins:2.19.1
